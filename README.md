## Summary

This project involves the development and execution of planners to collect patients from designated locations using an ambulance. Three different cases are explored, ranging from predefined routes to dynamic route planning. The execution of a competition planner is also attempted, with challenges encountered in the VSCode environment leading to its execution on the Linux system.

## Development

### Case 1: Predefined Routes
In the first case, a predefined route is provided for the ambulance to collect two patients and transport them to the hospital. The planner executes the specified route efficiently, ensuring the patients are collected and transported as intended.

### Case 2: Dynamic Route Planning
In the second case, the planner is given multiple route options to choose from, simulating obstacles that restrict access to certain routes. Despite the obstacles, the planner dynamically selects the optimal route to collect the patients and deliver them to the hospital.

### Case 3: Optimal Route Selection
In the third case, a larger map is created to test the planner's ability to find the most optimal route without significant delays. The planner successfully navigates the map, demonstrating its intelligence in selecting efficient routes.

### Competition Planner Implementation
An attempt is made to execute a competition planner within the VSCode environment, but challenges arise, leading to its execution on the Linux system instead. Despite initial difficulties, the competition planner is successfully executed, providing valuable insights into its functionality.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with reflections on the planner's autonomy and its ability to find optimal routes in the scenarios presented. Despite challenges in executing the competition planner within VSCode, valuable insights are gained, highlighting differences between programming in Linux and VSCode environments. The project reaffirms the importance of efficient route planning in emergency situations and showcases the effectiveness of planners in addressing such challenges.
